# GdxDemo3D
GdxDemo3D is a game project built with [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx), demonstrating various aspects of the game library, as well as its extensions, such as the physics engine [Bullet](http://bulletphysics.org/) wrapper and the artificial intelligence library [gdx-ai](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai).

A simple 3D world is included, with a multi storey house and various other items.

Animated human and dog characters are used as actors in the world. Ragdoll physics allows for dynamic character animation when a human falls down.

The [gdx-ai pathfinding](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai/wiki/Pathfinding) module in conjunction with a navigation mesh handles pathfinding, the [gdx-ai steering behaviors](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai/wiki/Steering-Behaviors) module handles character movement while [state machines](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai/wiki/State-Machine) and [behavior trees](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai/wiki/Behavior-Trees) are used to model human and dog brains respectively.

The Bullet physics library is used to handle collisions and forces between objects.

Objects in the world can be modified directly in Blender and exported into the game with an automated script.
